# JavaScript Project: Managing Two Lists with Item Deletion and Validation

## Introduction
This project is a simple JavaScript application that allows you to manage two separate lists. It includes functionality for adding items to each list, deleting items from each list, and validating user input. This project is suitable for learning and practicing basic JavaScript concepts.

## Features
- **Add Items to Lists**: Users can add new items to either of the two lists.
- **Delete Items**: Each item in the lists can be deleted.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs are not empty and duplicate items are not added.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you only need a web browser and a text editor. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the forms provided to add items to either of the lists.
3. To delete items, click the delete button next to each item.

## File Structure

.
├── index.html
├── assets/css/styles.css
├── assets/scss/style.scss
└── assets/js/script.js


### index.html
This file contains the basic HTML structure for displaying the two lists and the forms for adding items.

### styles.css
This file contains the styles for the appearance of the application.

### script.js
This file contains the JavaScript code for adding, deleting, and validating items.

## How It Works
1. **Adding Items**: When a user enters an item and clicks the add button, the JavaScript checks that the input is not empty and the item is not a duplicate. Then, the item is added to the appropriate list.
2. **Deleting Items**: Each item in the list has a delete button. Clicking this button removes the item from the list.
3. **Input Validation**: The JavaScript ensures that user inputs are not empty and items are not duplicated to prevent invalid entries.
